# pygame_graphics_engine
100% my own code and math. A graphics engine using only 2d rendering (pygame). Try up arrow.

s toggles mouse visibility
arrow keys move
esc toggles mouse lock

line 234 is where you can add cubes to be displayed

there are still a few things i need to fix but it is mostly done
